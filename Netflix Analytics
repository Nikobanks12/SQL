On this SQL code, I'm querying a Nexflix database




-- Here I am showing the total number of movies in this database excluding TV shows.---
SELECT count (*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech".netflix_titles_info
WHERE type = 'Movie';

--Here I am showing the most reacent data entry date.---
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--Listing all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.--
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech".netflix_titles_info
ORDER BY title asc;

-Here I am showing the director of the movie Bright Star.--
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
where titles.title='Bright Star';

- Here I am showing the oldest movie in the database with the year it was released.--
SELECT title,release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
